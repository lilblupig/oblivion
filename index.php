                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>In Bethesda's Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, there are a tremendous number of explorable locations, quests, collectible items and various other information that a player might wish to keep track of.  I personally struggle to keep up with what I have found, and of those, what I have explored.  I have used spreadsheets to keep track of this for years, but, since I play on PS3, it would be nice to have something a bit more phone friendly to hand.</p>
                        <p>I aim to build trackers for the categories listed out below and shown in the navigation bar, though I suspect this will be slow going as I learn how things work.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weapons</li>
                            <li>Armour</li>
                            <li>Settlements</li>
                            <li>Dungeons</li>
                            <li>Oblivion Gates</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As it stands at this point in time, basic lists are complete for Weapons, Armour and Gates but Settlements and Dungeons remain under construction.  I will aim to add in lists for tracking unique weapons and armour, and then move on to the remaining two categories.</p>
