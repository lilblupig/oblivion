                        <p>There can be a total of 60 Oblivion Gates which the player can close, though the number of these available at any point in the game varies.</p>
                        <p>Initially, only one gate is open; the great gate at Kvatch which features in the main quest.  As the player advances through the main quest a number of fixed gates will open, and a varying number of random gates may spawn.</p>
                        <p>The fixed gates largely relate to main quest required and optional tasks, and the random gates generally spawn when the player is within a certain proximity and certain conditions are met.</p>
